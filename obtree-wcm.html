                    <p>
                    With more than 10 years' experience with Obtree WCM, we are well placed to provide support and 
                    advice with technical
                        challenges you may have. 
                    We can offer one-off or ongoing support so please 
                    <a href="index.html?subject=obtree:support#contact" title="Contact Us">get in touch</a> 
                        if this is something you are interested in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can also provide bespoke training or mentoring engagements for your existing deployment 
                        to embellish the 
                        generic training provided by the vendor. I know this because I have 
                        delivered the generic Obtree courses when I worked for OpenText. 
                    </p>
                            
                    <p>
                        These courses, while excellent at conveying the core concepts, are often difficult to 
                        translate 
                    into <em>your</em> website's authoring and development processes, and we can translate 
                    these core concepts 
                    into focused procedures or techniques for your specific requirements. For further info,

                <div class="panel-text">
                    <p>As you may be aware, Obtree WCM was retired as an active product several years ago by 
                        OpenText. Consequently, the 
                    last release was version 9.8.4 in 2011.</p>
                    <p>However, you may be on an older version. We always recommend updating to the most recent 
                        version, particularly if you
                        are on a 9.7.n or earlier release.</p>
                    <p>We can offer advice and assistance should you wish to upgrade and/or transfer to a more 
                        up-to-date platform. We have 
                        confirmed that Obtree 9.8.4 will run on Server 2008 and Server 2012, though it is not 
                        officially supported on the latter operating system.
                    </p>

                        We can provide a full development offering using the underlying power of the Obtree WCM

                        In addition to the powerful core user and content management features allowing us to build 
                        bespoke and focused 
                    editorial interfaces and processes, Obtree WCM also offers a wide variety of full application 
                    development features,
                    that were significantly ahead of its time when first released in the early 2000s.

                    <p>

                        <li>easy exposure of Obtree WCM APIs to external sources (built-in and customisable SOAP

                    <p>
                        There is a current trend for so-called 'headless' CMS systems. That is, provision of content deliberately divorced 
                        from a presentation layer such that other applications can easily consume the content. This usually means
                        that the content is provided in a structured form such as XML or JSON, including the content itself and 
                        any associated metadata (lifecycle information, keywords etc.)
                    </p>
                    <p>Although not originally designed with this in mind, Obtree WCM is eminently suited for this role. It is extremely
                    simple to expose the content as XML, more-or-less out of the box.</p>
                    <p>Further, because of the underlying object model, it is also straightforward to build a REST interface for editing
                    of the content, should that be a requirement</p>
                    <p>We believe that this model can extend the life of your software , particularly if there has been many years of 
                    editorial investment in content creation.</p>
